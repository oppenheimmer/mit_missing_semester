## Why this class?

During a traditional Computer Science education, chances are you will take 
plenty of advanced classes: everything from _Operating Systems_ to 
_Programming Languages_, to _Machine Learning_. But at many institutions there 
is one essential topic that is rarely covered: computing ecosystem literacy.

Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform 
repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools. 
In the best case, these result in inefficiencies and wasted time; in the worst 
case, these result in issues like data loss or inability to complete tasks.

The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing 
ecosystem that could make studentsâ€™ lives significantly easier. Topics that 
will be covered include:

- Command shell: How to automate the boring, repetitive tasks with aliases, 
scripts and build systems.

- Version control: How to use version control properly and take advantage of 
it to save projects from disaster, collaborate with others and quickly find 
problematic changes.

- Text editing: How to use editing from command line, both locally and remotely,
and take advantage of advanced editor features.

- Remote machines: How to work with SSH keys and terminal multiplexing.

- Finding files: How to quickly and efficiently look for the files.

- Data wrangling: How to quickly modify, view, parse, plot and compute over 
data and files from the command line.

- Virtual machines: How to try out new systems and isolate projects, keeping 
you machine clean & tidy.

- Security: How to effectively and efficiently manage computer security. Basics
of encryption, computer network security etc.
