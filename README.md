# The Missing semester of your CS education

## Motivation

As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in
repetitive tasks and automation. However, far too often, we forget that 
this fact applies just as much to our _usage_ patterns, as it does to the 
tasks we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools
available at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and
solve more complex problems when working with computers. Yet many of us 
utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we only know enough magical 
incantations by rote to get by, and blindly copy-paste commands from the 
internet when we get stuck.

We want to teach you how to make the most of the tools you know, show
you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some
excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own.
